# Frenz personal portofolio website [WIP]

Made in #React.js for didactical and fun purpose, this is my modest and unusual website :D <br>
I've tried to create a cartoon design, focused on mobile experience rather than desktop <br>
<b>Actually it is in WIP, because i'm improving the desktop experience</b></br>

#Technologies

I've experimented once again the power of #React.js for "FrontEnding" in a easy and powerful way, tried the superEasy world of #FontAwesome and his features<br>
and finally i've learn to use #emailJS to create a valid and functional contact form for my website, and it works great! :> <br>
Also, i wanted to use the amazing #animateCss to easily add some effects to my site, the result is really awesome! <br>

Hope you like my work! :)
